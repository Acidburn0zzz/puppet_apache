puppet module apache
====================

This module tries to manage apache on different distros in a similar manner. a
few additional directories have to be created as well some configuration files
have to be deployed to fit this schema.

! Upgrade Notice !

 currently deployed apache::config::file resources could be broken
 so one should change occurences of this resource's argument from:

      source => "modules/site-apache/blah"

 to a full source specification string:

      source => "puppet:///modules/site-apache/blah"


vhosts can be added with the vhosts define:
(currently only plain vhosts file are supported)

apache::vhosts::file { '$domain' }
